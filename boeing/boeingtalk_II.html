<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Bookman L">Developers
burning the midnight oil trying to meet deadlines.  Project managers
balancing the desires of customers and the realities of schedules. 
QA trying to track and manage thousands of bugs in systems. These are
heroic efforts of hard working, talented people that more often than
not lead to spectacular failures.  Yet these are the hallmarks of
modern software projects.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Bookman L">Developing
software in legacy systems is even more precarious.  To these
participants these projects are often like paratrooping into the
middle of a raging forest fire, holding back the flames with a
McCloud in one hand and creating origami swans with the other.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Bookman L">Spectacular
failures lead to two responses: control and fatalism.  Control posits
that more careful planning will lead to less chaos and greater
returns. Fatalism dictates that all planning is worthless so why even
try.  Unfortunately, experience teaches that both approaches doomed. </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Bookman L">The problem is
change.  Requirement changes, technology changes, funding changes and
personnel changes all conspire to inseminate chaos into the best laid
plans.  These changes are perpetrated by the reality that many of a
projects technologies, designs, approaches and even requirements are
both unknown and unknowable before the product is created.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Bookman L">Careful planning
does not eliminate the cost of this change because change is usually
unpredictable. Indeed, trying to predict change usually introduces
overwhelming accidental complexity into a project. Using a chaotic
development process invariably succumbs to the exponential cost of
additional changes in a poorly designed software product.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Bookman L">In this, talk we
examine Extreme Programming (XP). XP is a disciplined method of
embracing change to deliver quality products on time and budget.
Extreme programming uses metrics to keep the cost of change
predictable and flat. It is not a revolutionary technology, but a
collection of best practices. Taken together, these practices 
fundamentally transform how we approach the development of software.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><FONT FACE="Bookman L"><FONT SIZE=2>Carmine
Mangione has been teaching Agile Methodologies and Extreme
Programming (XP) to Fortune 500 companies for the past 2 years. He
has developed unique materials show teams how to move from standard
methodologies and non-object oriented programming to Extreme
Programming and Object Oriented Analysis and Programming (OOAP). 
These courses teach developers, analysts and managers how to develop
high-quality, timely software without surrendering the large amount
of value that exists in legacy systems.  In addition, he has
developed techniques to move these techniques into organizations
without disrupting current processes.</FONT></FONT></P>

has also used XP to deliver several very successful commercial
systems. Carmine is currently the CTO of X-Spaces, Inc. where he has
created an XP team and delivered a peer-to-peer based communications
infrastructure. As principal architect of Excite Clubs, Carmine used
XP techniques to create a clubs product capable of handling  100M
page views per day.  As Bootleg's principal architect, Carmine
introduced XP and led the team that built the company's
&quot;MediaBooster&quot; platform and delivered the product in less
than six months. Carmine is also a Professor at Seattle University
where he teaches graduate level courses in Relational Databases,
Object Oriented Design (OOD), UI Design, Parallel and Distributed
Computing, and Advanced Java Programming. Prior to this he was Chief
Scientist at Redmond Communications. Carmine holds a B.S. in
Aerospace Engineering from Cal Poly Institute and earned his M.S. in
Computer Science from UC Irvine.</FONT></FONT> </FONT>
